**This project is under heavy development, it's not in a working state yet!**

Where does this name come from or what does it mean? It's quite simple, it's one german word for paste/glue, I thought it's a good match as it glues together the modpacks for Minecraft.

This repository stores all the scripting used within the maintainance of the project and all the repositories.
